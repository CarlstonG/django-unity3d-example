# Django-Unity-tutorial #

Django-Unity-Tutorial is an example project of how to use Django as a backend for a Unity3D game. 

### Notes ###
This repository is currently set up using Microsoft Visual Studio and Python Tools for VS, however, you should be able to run this django project on Linux and Mac considered you've got the dependencies(django, restframework). As this is just an example project, this does *not* cover deploying or getting ready for production.

### Goals ###
To have a minimal backend this example project should include the following features:
* Players can signup using an email and password
* Players can login
* Players will be able to save their score and get a list of all scores
* Players can save their game(blob of data) and retreive a list of saved games

* Django v1.7.1
* Django-rest-framework v3.0.2
* Unity3D v4.3+
* MS Visual Studio Community 2013 
* Python tools v2.1 for Visual Studio
